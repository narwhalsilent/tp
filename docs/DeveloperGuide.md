### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that has three different views. Each view consists of parts which
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.
1. The **person tab view** is made up of four parts:
`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`.
2. The **loan tab view** is made up of four parts:
`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LoanListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`.
3. The **analytics tab view** is made up of four parts:
`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AnalyticsPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component, which could switch between the different views.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component,
as it displays `Person`, `Loan` and `Analytics` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the loan records data i.e., all `Loan` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueLoanList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Loan` objects (e.g., results of a view loan command) as a separate
  _filtered_ and _sorted_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Loan>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Enhancements Added

[//]: <> (change it to the analytics function)

### Loan Analytics - Joseph

#### Implementation

The `Analytics` class handles the analysis of a `UniqueLoanList` object. This class can only be instantiated by calling the
static method `getAnalytics(UniqueLoanList uniqueLoanList)`.

It contains the following fields that can prove to be useful for the user:

* `numLoans`: total number of loans
* `numOverdueLoans`: total number of overdue loans
* `numActiveLoans`: total number of active loans
* `propOverdueLoans`: proportion of loans that are overdue over active loans
* `propActiveLoans`: proportion of loans that are active over total loans
* `totalValueLoaned`: total value of all loans
* `totalValueOverdue`: total value of all overdue loans
* `totalValueActive`: total value of all active loans
* `averageLoanValue`: average loan value of all loans
* `averageOverdueValue`: average loan value of all overdue loans
* `averageActiveValue`: average loan value of all active loans
* `earliestLoanDate`: earliest loan date of all loans
* `earliestReturnDate`: earliest return date of active loans
* `latestLoanDate`: latest loan date of all loans
* `latestReturnDate`: latest return date of active loans

The `AnalyticsCommand` class handles the viewing of analytics of any one person within the current contact list in view. 
The following shows how the analytics class is used in the execution of a command to view the analytics of a person:
![AnalyticsSequenceDiagram](images/AnalyticsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Initialization of the Analytics object:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Initialize the Analytics class using a factory method.
    * Pros: Hide the constructor from the user, ensure that fields are initialized correctly, more defensive.
    * Cons: Slightly more complex than a public constructor.

* **Alternative 2:** Initialize the Analytics class using a public constructor.
    * Pros: More straightforward to use.
    * Cons: User may not initialize the fields correctly, less defensive.

##### Aspect: What fields to include in the analytics:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Include all fields.
    * Pros: Satisfy 'ask, don't tell' principle.
    * Cons: Possibly result in redundant information for the GUI developer.

* **Alternative 2:** Include only raw data (e.g. total number of loans, total value of all loans).
    * Pros: No redundant information.
    * Cons: GUI developer has to calculate the analytics themselves, violating 'ask, don't tell' principle.

### Delete Loan - Xiaorui

#### Implementation

The `DeleteLoanCommand` class handles the deletion of a loan from the current contact in view, and executes the command 
after the input is parsed and transformed into an appropriate format.
The parsing of the command is done by the `DeleteLoanCommandParser` class, which is responsible for parsing the user
input.

The `DeleteLoanCommand` class is instantiated in the `DeleteLoanCommandParser` class, while the
`DeleteLoanCommandParser` is instantiated in the `AddressBookParser` class. Both classes are instantiated when the user
enters a `deleteloan` command, which needs to be of the format `deleteloan INDEX`
where INDEX is the index of the loan to be deleted (which is a positive whole number).

The `DeleteLoanCommand` class contains the following fields which can prove to be useful for the user:

* `loanIndex`: the index of the loan to be deleted
* Several string fields that are displayed to the user under different scenarios.

The `DeleteLoanCommandParser` class does not contain any fields.

Sequence diagram for the deletion of a loan:

![DeleteLoanSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteLoanSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: How the command is executed:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `DeleteLoanCommand` class is responsible for executing the command only.
    * Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Simpler to debug.
    * Cons: May result in more classes.
* **Alternative 2:** The `LogicManager` class is responsible for executing the command.
    * Pros: More centralized command execution.
    * Cons: May result in the `LogicManager` class becoming too large. This also goes against various SWE principles,
      and makes the code harder to maintain.

##### Aspect: How the command is parsed:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `DeleteLoanCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command.
    * Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Simpler to debug.
    * Cons: May result in more classes.
* **Alternative 2:** The `AddressBookParser` class is responsible for parsing the command.
    * Pros: More centralized command parsing.
    * Cons: May result in the `AddressBookParser` class becoming too large. This also goes against various SWE
      principles, and makes the code harder to maintain.

### Loan view command - Wang Junwu

#### Implementation

The `ViewLoanCommand` class handles the viewing of all loans attached to a contact, and executes the command after the
input is parsed and transformed into an appropriate format.
The parsing of the command is done by the `ViewLoanCommandParser` class,
which is responsible for parsing the user input.

The `ViewLoanCommand` class is instantiated in the `ViewLoanCommandParser` class, while the
`ViewLoanCommandParser` is instantiated in the `AddressBookParser` class. Both classes are instantiated when the user
enters a `viewloan` command, which needs to be of the format `viewloan INDEX`
where INDEX is the index of the person whose loans are to be viewed, a positive whole number.

The `ViewLoanCommand` class contains the following fields which can prove to be useful for the user:
* `targetIndex`: the index of the person whose loans are to be viewed
* Some string fields that are displayed to the user under different scenarios.

The `ViewLoanCommandParser` class does not contain any fields.

Sequence diagram for the viewing of loans:
![ViewLoanSequenceDiagram](images/ViewLoanSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: How the loan list is accessed:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `ViewLoanCommand.execute()` method sequentially obtains the person list,
the person, and then the loan list.
    * Pros: Minimises the layers of methods to follow through.
    * Cons: May violate the SLAP principle and the Law of Demeter.
* **Alternative 2:** The `ViewLoanCommand.execute()` method obtains the loan list directly from the `Model`.
    * Pros: Follows the SLAP principle and the Law of Demeter. Better use of abstraction.
    * Cons: May result in longer method chains.

##### Aspect: How the command is parsed:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `ViewLoanCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command.
    * Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Simpler to debug.
    * Cons: May result in more classes.
* **Alternative 2:** The `AddressBookParser` class is responsible for parsing the command.
    * Pros: More centralized command parsing.
    * Cons: May result in the `AddressBookParser` class becoming too large. This also goes against various SWE
      principles
      ,and makes the code harder to maintain.

### Loan view GUI - Kyal Sin Min Thet

#### Implementation

The GUI component to display loans attached to a contact is implemented in tandem with the `viewloan` command.

The update behaviour is achieved through the use of `ObservableList` objects in the `Model` component. The `MainWindow`
component listens for changes in the `ObservableList` objects and updates the GUI accordingly.

The `LoanListPanel` (similar to `PersonListPanel`) is responsible for displaying the list of loans attached to a
contact. It generates new `LoanCard` objects according to the `loanList` in the `Model` class.
To accommodate the new GUI component, the `MainWindow.java` file is updated to include the new `LoanListPanel`.

To ensure that only either the loan list or the person list is displayed, an additional `BooleanProperty` is added to
the `Model`
component to act as a flag to indicate which list is currently being displayed. This flag is updated by corresponding
commands.
For instance, commands such as `list` will toggle the flag to false, while `viewloan` will toggle the flag to true.
This update switches the display between the two lists inside `MainWindow`.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How the GUI is updated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The GUI updates are done by the `Model` component's observable properties.
    * Pros: Follows the observer design pattern, reducing coupling between the `Model` and `MainWindow` components.
    * Cons: The GUI updates are restricted to the observable properties of the `Model` component.

* **Alternative 2:** The GUI updates are done by the `MainWindow` component.
    * Pros: More explicit control over the GUI updates.
    * Cons: `Model` needs a reference to `MainWindow` to update the GUI directly. This increases coupling between the
      components.

### Linking a loan - Khor Jun Wei

#### Implementation

Linking a loan is implemented through the `linkloan` command, which adds a loan to the list. This was achieved through
the addition of a `LinkLoanCommand` class, which handles the retrieval of targets (the target loan and person)
and the execution of the command.

The `LinkLoanCommand` class is instantiated in the `LinkLoanCommandParser` class, while the
`LinkLoanCommandParser` is instantiated in the `AddressBookParser` class. Both classes are instantiated when the user
enters a `linkloan` command, which needs to be of the format `linkloan INDEX v/VALUE s/START_DATE r/RETURN_DATE`
where INDEX (a positive whole number) is the index of the person, VALUE (a positive decimal number) is the value of the loan,
and START_DATE and RETURN_DATE (both dates in the format yyyy-mm-dd) are the start and return dates of the loan respectively. 

The `LinkLoanCommand` class contains the following fields which can prove to be useful for the user:

* `toLink`: the description of the loan to be linked as a `LinkLoanDescriptor`, including its value, start date and return date
* `linkTarget`: the index of the person to link the loan to
* Several string fields that are displayed to the user under different scenarios.

Sequence diagram for the linking of loans:
![LinkLoanSequenceDiagram](images/LinkLoanSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How the command is executed:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `LinkLoanCommand` class is responsible for executing the command only.
    * Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Simpler to debug.
    * Cons: May result in more classes.
* **Alternative 2:** The `LogicManager` class is responsible for executing the command.
    * Pros: More centralized command execution.
    * Cons: May result in the `LogicManager` class becoming too large. This also goes against various SWE principles,
      and makes the code harder to maintain.

##### Aspect: How the command parameters (i.e. loan details) are stored:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The parameters are stored in a temporary `LinkLoanDescriptor`, 
which is then passed into the `LinkLoanCommand`.
    * Pros: As it follows the style of the `EditCommand`, it is simpler to debug. In addition, it follows the Single Responsibility Principle
  as then the `LinkLoanDescriptor` will be in charge of handling the loan details.
  * Cons: An additional `LinkLoanDescriptor` nested class is needed in `LinkLoanCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Each detail about the loan (e.g. value, start date) is stored
separately in the `LinkLoanCommand`.
    * Pros: Eliminates the need for any additional classes.
    * Cons: Reduces the ease for potentially adding new loan details in the future,
  as then each time a new field would need to be added to `LinkLoanCommand`. In addition,
  may be more difficult to debug due to novelty of code.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

The target user is businessman who satisfies the following criteria

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

and wants to manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app. Typically,
they want to answer the following questions quickly:

* How much cash was loaned?
* To whom it was loaned to?
* When the person is due to return the loan?
* When did the person last loan?

**Value proposition**: Manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

Our address book is tailored for business owners whose job might involve loaning items on a
regular basis. It simplifies loan categorization and tracks product quality post-return,
ensuring efficient decision-making. Some boundaries include no detailed client reviews or
personal loan management, as we focus solely on business loans and contact management for
a select client group.

Our software streamlines loanee management, preventing profit loss and enhancing partner relations.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
   1. Close the app. Choose either to simulate a missing data file or corrupted data file, but not both.

   1. _To simulate a missing file, go to ./data and delete the JSON file inside, where . refers to 
   th directory containing the jar file._
   2. _To simulate a corrupted file, open the JSON file and delete a few characters from the middle of the file._

   1. Launch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app should launch successfully. A new JSON file should be created in the
      ./data folder. For a missing file, the address book should show the sample data. 
      For a corrupted file, a blank address book should be shown.
   2. After populating the address book with some data, repeat steps i to iv for the other of missing/corrupted.

2. After performing several operations that changes the data (e.g. linkloan, add a person, etc.),
   ensure that closing and re-opening the app retains the changed data.

### Exiting the app

You can exit the app in the following ways:
1. Click the close button on the window title bar.<br>

2. Enter `exit` into the GUI.

In either case, the app should close.

## **Appendix: Effort**

The main effort for this project was spent on creating the loan management features, which were not present in AB3. 
These include:
* linking a loan
* viewing loans
* marking and unmarking a loan 
* deleting loans
* editing loans
* viewing analytics of a contact

Much inspiration was drawn from the existing commands in AB3, as well as the tutorial to add a new command.

While the first five features looked similar, some required more effort than the others. 
The main difficulty we faced include how to implement the deletion and editing of loans.
We had to ensure deletion can only happen if that loan is currently within view, else there could 
easily be mistakes. Likewise for editing a loan. The solution we came up with was to alter the 
person and loan lists in view, based on the commands given. Based on the lists in view, we decide 
if each operation can be done. 

The analytics feature was the most challenging feature to implement. This is because we needed to define
the analytics that we wanted to show, and then implement the logic to calculate these analytics. The GUI, 
in particular the pie chart, was also challenging to implement.

Nonetheless, we managed to implement all the features we set out to do, and we are proud of the final product. 
In particular, we are proud of the analytics feature, which we believe is a unique feature that sets our app apart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. After executing viewloan, if we call `viewloan 1`, the error message provided states "The person index is invalid". 
    A better error message would be something like "Please run the list command before running this command again".
2. When entering an email for a new person in the form of  `name@domain`(e.g. `jameshoexample@com`), an error message should be displayed and 
    the new person shouldn't be added, as opposed to the current behaviour. This is because emails are typically 
    in the form of `local-part@mail-server.domain`(`jameshoexample@gmail.com`)
3. Detect duplicate names, including case insensitive ones. For example, if we have a person named "John Doe", 
    we should not be able to add another person named "john doe". 
4. Do not allow the `/` character inside any field when adding a new person, since it is a special character for prefixes.
5. Error message for the `linkloan` command should be more specific to the error, e.g. different error messages for 
incorrect date format and a start date before end date.
6. All fields should have a minimum length of 1 character and maximum length of 100 characters. 
Otherwise, an error message should be displayed, e.g. for name, "Name cannot be empty" or 
"Name is cannot exceed 100 characters". Similar for other fields.
7. Error messages related to indices should be more specific to the error. 
For example, if the user enters `viewloan 0`, the error message should be something like "INDEX must be a positive integer".
If the user enters `viewloan 8` when there are only 7 contacts, the error message should be something like "INDEX must be between 1 and 7".
8. Reject loans that are > 2 decimal places as invalid. 
For those loans that are < 2 decimal places, change them to 2 decimal places
format when displaying them instead of showing their exact value.
